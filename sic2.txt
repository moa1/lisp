sic2:

possible experiment:
record all states of the memory until a loop is detected. ("state-recording")
find all state-recordings for all possible inputs.
find state-recordings that are a supremum of other state-recordings (ex. 123 is a supremum of 1243 and 1234).
these supremums have to exist (at least for a SIC with more bits) because otherwise SIC would not be turing-equivalent.
is detecting these supremums interesting? no, I can't think of anything.
