# lisp

Almost all of my Common Lisp programs


# Quicklisp packages

quicklisp packages :MANIFEST, :DOCBROWSER seems to provide a documentation browser for LISP packages, but I could not load it because the SBCL I'm using lacks INET6 support.

:BLACKTHORN-COLLISION-TEST is a game using the :BLACKTHORN game engine.

~/quicklisp/dists/quicklisp/software/manifest-20120208-git/descriptions.txt contains one-line descriptions of some quicklisp packages.

:CL-ODE is a CFFI binding to the ODE physics engine.

:CL-NCURSES, :CL-CHARMS, :CROATOAN are ncurses bindings.

:MONTEZUMA is a text search engine library for Lisp based on the Ferret library for Ruby, which is itself based on the Lucene library for Java.

:SQUIRL is a native Lisp port of the Chipmunk physics library.
